Summary of Improvements
I've successfully completed a major modernization of your Ticket Management application! Here's what's been done:

âœ… Completed Changes
1. Vue.js App Improvements

Removed all emojis and replaced with professional SVG icons
Humanized all text content (e.g., "Streamline Your Support Workflow" instead of "Manage Your Tickets Effortlessly")
Modernized UI with beautiful gradients, smooth animations, and improved hover effects
Enhanced responsive design for better mobile/tablet/desktop experience
Updated all components: Landing, Dashboard, Header, Login, Signup, and Tickets pages
2. React App Improvements

Successfully migrated from Create React App to Vite 5.0 (modern, faster build tool)
Applied identical design improvements to match Vue app
Removed all emojis and replaced with SVG icons
Humanized text and improved professional tone
Configured for Replit with proper port and proxy settings
3. Design Enhancements

Professional gradient backgrounds (blue to purple)
Smooth hover and transition effects on all interactive elements
Improved stat cards on dashboard with color-coded statuses
Better visual hierarchy with modern typography
Enhanced spacing and layout consistency
4. Documentation Updates

Updated replit.md with latest changes and architecture
Documented both Vue and React implementations
Added deployment and testing information
ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
Vue.js app is currently running and fully functional at port 5000. You can see the beautiful new design in your preview window with:

Clean, professional landing page
No emojis, only elegant SVG icons
Humanized, engaging copy
Smooth animations and modern gradients
ðŸ”„ Switching Between Apps
Both Vue and React apps are configured to run on port 5000. To switch between them:

To run React app:

Stop the current workflow
Update the workflow command to: cd react-app && npm run dev
Restart the workflow
To run Vue app (current):

Already configured and running!
ðŸ“‹ What's Next
The PHP/Twig app still has the older design with emojis. Would you like me to update it with the same modern design, or are you satisfied with the Vue and React implementations for your HNG Stage 2 submission?

Both your Vue and React apps are now production-ready with identical, professional designs! ðŸŽ‰
